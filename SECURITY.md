# Security Policy 🔐

Look, this is a personal playground for a local Hermes agent, not Fort Knox. Still, here’s how I pretend to be a responsible adult:

## Supported Versions

Security fixes happen when I’m caffeinated enough to notice something’s on fire.
If it’s on `main`, it’s “supported.” Anything else is archaeological debris.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find something horrifying:

- Send an email to **human@checkmarkdevtools.dev**.
- Use a calm tone so I don’t immediately assume you’re blaming me for life choices I didn’t make—there's plenty of them I did already!
- If the bug involves actual security risk, say that. “My feelings are hurt” does not qualify—feature, not bug.

## What to Expect

- I’ll look at it.
- *Eventually.*
- If it’s real, I’ll fix it.
- If it’s not, I’ll quietly judge your threat modeling and move on.

## Responsible Behavior

Please do not:

- Try to brute-force the memory system just to see what happens. It will remember. So will I.
- “Fix security” by deleting half the repo and calling it a day.
- Email me every 15 minutes asking for updates. Time is a construct and I respect none of it.

## Disclosure

This repo is a toy-but-not-a-toy sandbox. Treat it like something fragile, brilliant, and held together with string and spite.
If you break it, congrats, now you get to help fix it.
If I break it, it was possibly intentional, and I'll fix it. *Eventually.*
